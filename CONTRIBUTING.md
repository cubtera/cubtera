# Contribution guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing to rust-gh-example.

If your contribution is not straightforward, please first discuss the change you
wish to make by creating a new issue before making the change.

## Reporting issues

Before reporting an issue on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/cubtera/cubtera/issues),
please check that it has not already been reported by searching for some related
keywords.

## Pull requests

Try to do one pull request per change.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Type must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Updating the changelog

Update the changes you have made in
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cubtera/cubtera/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
file under the **Unreleased** section.

Add the changes of your pull request to one of the following subsections,
depending on the types of changes defined by
[Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/):

- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.

If the required subsection does not exist yet under **Unreleased**, create it!

  cargo build --release && cargo run --release
  ```

- Run Clippy:

  ```shell
  cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --workspace
  ```

- Run all tests:

  ```shell
  cargo test --all-features --workspace
  ```

- Check to see if there are code formatting issues

  ```shell
  cargo fmt --all -- --check
  ```
